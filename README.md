# WIKI (CS50W/2020)

## Description
This a wikipedia-like website developed with the specifications of Project 01 from cs50w - Edx/Harvard course. The description of what the web-app must do can be found at https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/1/wiki/.  
Please note that the specifications of this project is focused in the backend development, so almost all efforts were made to make de application work as it was designed. 

## Features
The project has a main page, where the complete list of the articles are listed with links to each one of them.  
In the side menu there is a link to search for articles and to return to home page. I this side menu, there is also a link to create a new page, it accepts text in markdown format and converts to HTML to show on web browser. Finally, this menu  main page has the "Random Page" button to, as it says, lead to a random article.  
Every article has a button to allow the user to edit it. 

## How to run it?
As the project is proposed in the CS50W course, it isn't running on any server. So it must be executed locally. To do it, it requires a computer running python, django and markdown2.  
Clone the repository, choose the application directory and run the command: **python manage.py runserver**

## Current status
Finished.
